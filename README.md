# DigitDraw
This is a sample project using FNN and CNN for digit recognition. 
Still in development phase. 
You draw a digit and the models try to recognise it as best as it can - as simple as that. 
There are two models: FNN on numpy and CNN on Tensorflow. 
Also models not simply recognize digits, but hopefully also train on them.
As a result, the quality of predictions should continue improving as long as you use it. 
Still figuring out which web framework is best to release a web application...
